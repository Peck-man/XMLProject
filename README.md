# XMLProject
 This program was created to demonstrate my ability to understand the assignment and my level of Java knowledge. This app is able to download zipped xml file
 url website. Then the program is able to unzipped and find the desired values in xml file. These values are stored in sql db and the relationship between them
 is created. Java, MySql, Spring were used to develop it. The toughest challenge was to understand the xml structure and how to retrieve it. In future we can 
 take a look at using more values e.g. streets and post codes for more various table-relationship. This project is easy to run. You can just open it with your
 favorite IDE, connect to your database and run it.
